# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# Post.first_or_create(title: "post one" , body: "post one body ")
# Post.first_or_create(title: "post two" , body: "post two body ")
# Post.first_or_create(title: "post three" , body: "post three body ")
# Post.first_or_create(title: "post four" , body: "post four body ")

# Comment.create(body: "comment one for post one" , post_id: 1)
# Comment.create(body: "comment two for post one" , post_id: 1)
# Comment.create(body: "comment one for post two" , post_id: 2)
# Comment.create(body: "comment one for post three" , post_id: 3)
